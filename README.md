# Final Project - Group 6

![Cosplay Club](https://i.imgur.com/8A3UU3J.jpg)

Cosplay Club is a cosplay contest app where users will submit their cosplay image on the theme/topic. Judges can use our JuDAO to vote for the winner.

- Submissions & Votes will be displayed on the frontend.
- The winner will receive a special NFT Prize & Tokens.🏆💵🤑
- ✨Magic ✨


## Why?

- To demostrate how to successfully run a virtual contest on blockchain.
- Make contest judging decentralised with a DAO.
- An easy dapp for general public to get a feel of web3.

## Project Structure

- **Frontend I** - For Users (submissions, votes, top ...)
- **Frontend II** - For DAO users (vote on a submission)
- **Web Backend** (handle form submissions, uploading to ipfs)
- **Contract I** - ERC721 for user submission (Image NFTs)
- **Contract II** - For DAO, store votes
- Other contracts for DAO (gov token, membership nft)
